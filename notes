blueblimp: I think the way it goes is, unless blocked or it would move
   the monster farther from you, basicseek prefers to keep using the same axis;
   and there is a special case saying that if the player's current or previous
   position, projected on the monster's line of movement, is the same as the
   monster's position, then the monster prefers to switch axis if it can

blueblimp: hm, there seems to be a special case where if the player moved more
   than 1 tile, then the player's previous position is ignored
