1. move towards the player
2. avoid walls
3. move towards the player’s previous position (ignored if the player moved more than one tile!)
4. keep the same direction
5. tie-break using the rules below

coordinates are (cross-axis, main-axis)

tracking: left
y, 1: vert
1, x: right
2, 2: leap || y ≤ 0 ? right : vert
y, 2: leap ? right : vert
y, x: right

tracking: right
1, x: left
y, 1: vert
2, 2: left
y, 2: leap ? left : vert
y, x: left

tracking: up
1, y: down
x, 1: right
2, 2: leap || y > 0 ? down : right
x, 2: leap ? down : right
x, y: down

tracking: up
x, 1: left
1, y: down
x, 2: leap ? down : left
x, y: down

tracking: down
1, y: up
x, 1: right
2, 2: leap || y > 0 ? up : right
x, 2: leap ? up : right
x, y: up

tracking: down
x, 1: left
1, y: up
x, 2: leap ? up : left
x, y: up

# switch iff dx == 1 or (dx == 2 and no_leap and (abs(dy) > 2 or (abs(dy) == 2 and y > 0)))

blueblimp: I think the way it goes is, unless blocked or it would move
   the monster farther from you, basicseek prefers to keep using the same axis;
   and there is a special case saying that if the player's current or previous
   position, projected on the monster's line of movement, is the same as the
   monster's position, then the monster prefers to switch axis if it can

blueblimp: hm, there seems to be a special case where if the player moved more
   than 1 tile, then the player's previous position is ignored
