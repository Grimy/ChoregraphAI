TO TEST:
* Different damage sources on proximity-mine and wind gargoyles
* Are enemies pushed back by wind gargoyles?
* Do elemental transform the floor before/after moving/digging/attacking/knockback?
* Will dragons/nightmares trample monsters when they could avoid it?
* Will golems bump into monsters when they could dig?
* Hitting monkeys while on Ooze
* `ABS(d.y) != 2` in basic_seek looks weird

TO CODE:
* Ice
* Assassins
* Armored skeletons (attack direction!)
* Chest mimics
* Refactor harpy AI
* Fix player reconfused on same beat
* Fix enemies digging while confused
* Consider renaming most AI functions

REPORT:
* Different aggression mechanics in the level editor

Harpy priority:
   N
  IFJ
 HDBDK
MEA.CGO

metal doors try to close themselves before and after each player turn, except
on the first two turns they are open. This explains both the weird priority
thing and the fact that metal doors never close on the turn after opening, even
if there’s nothing in the way.

There is a fourth damage type besides regular, piercing, phasing. I call it
“bomb-like”. Bomb-like damage always hurts blademasters, but doesn’t hurt other
armored enemies (beetles). Bomb-like damage never triggers warlock teleports.
The following sources deal bomb-like damage: bombs (duh), Boots of Lunging,
spike traps and all fireballs (traps, spells, scrolls and Red Dragons; didn’t
test it with DM)

blueblimp: I think the way it goes is, unless blocked or it would move
   the monster farther from you, basicseek prefers to keep using the same axis;
   and there is a special case saying that if the player's current or previous
   position, projected on the monster's line of movement, is the same as the
   monster's position, then the monster prefers to switch axis if it can

blueblimp: hm, there seems to be a special case where if the player moved more
   than 1 tile, then the player's previous position is ignored
