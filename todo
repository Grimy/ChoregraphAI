TESTS:
* green bats
* for each class change: how are damage/max_delay/lordness/radius/priority affected?
* bomb traps; goblin bombers before/after
* goblin diggers vs Z4WALLs

FEATURES:
* metal doors (type=111)
* confusion de-aggroing enemies?
* items write to the player struct

BUGFIXES:
* yetis/mummies/sarcos: should have been aggroed for a full turn
* beetle shedding isn’t quite right
* banshees/skeletons should have different activation radii depending on the zone
* charged breath attacks should have extreme priority
* clonking should hit both player and monkey
* metrognomes should reset tracking dir when hit with weapons
* bombs shouldn’t damage fresh skull spawns
* bombs shouldn’t damage unaggroed enemies
* pixies should emit light
* chain lightning should emit light
* pixie explosions are *weird*

REFACTORS:
* Use more references
* Refactor chain_lightning
* Only link against libstdc++ in debug
* Go ECS or go home
* Rename _can_charge → something
* Rename cast_light → something with octants
* Use WIRE/WIRE_DOOR classes instead of .wired ???
