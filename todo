TESTS:
* do yetis clap after digging?
* knock riders, wind statues and bomb statues into the player
* digging enemies vs metal doors
* do mommies summon after attacking?
* mommy activation radius?
* mommy spawn order?
* do turnip/skeletons spawn already aggroed?

BUGFIXES:
* metal doors (type=111) should close themselves
* minotaurs should have digging power 3 while charging
* moles shouldn’t be able to move through water/tar
* knockback shouldn’t free enemies from water/tar
* bombs shouldn’t damage unaggroed enemies

REFACTORS:
* basic_seek should return a value for mommies/yetis
* Refactor harpy AI
* Dragon exhaustion is implemented in a stupid way
* (type % 100) + offset[type / 100] ?

Metal doors try to close themselves before and after each player turn, except
on the first two turns they are open. This explains both the weird priority
thing and the fact that metal doors never close on the turn after opening, even
if there’s nothing in the way.
