TESTS:
* Check all confusion/freeze/iframe mechanics again
* Edge cases of bomb/nightmare/revealed aggro
* Is light from held torches added to wall torches?
* Check activation radii of Z5 mobs

FEATURES:
* electric mages
* metal doors (type=111)
* lord enemies
* (priority, L2) sorting of the monster queue

BUGFIXES:
* beetle shedding isn’t quite right
* banshees should have different activation radii depending on the zone
* shovemonsters pushing the player on ice shoud trigger a slide
* when monkeyed while trapped in tar, the player should stay trapped
* charged breath attacks should have extreme priority
* skeleton knights should take two stacks of damage from fire traps
* monkey should tank explosions/fireballs for the player
* clonking should hit both player and monkey
* bombs shouldn’t damage unaggroed enemies
* pixie explosions shouldn’t change terrain or destroy phasing enemies (but still destroy traps/walls)
* non-player damage on Goolem shouldn’t spawn ooze

REFACTORS:
* Refactor harpy AI
* Don’t rely on qsort being stable

Metal doors try to close themselves before and after each player turn, except
on the first two turns they are open. This explains both the weird priority
thing and the fact that metal doors never close on the turn after opening, even
if there’s nothing in the way.
