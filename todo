TESTS:
* Edge cases of bomb/nightmare/revealed aggro

FEATURES:
* metal doors (type=111) should close themselves
* green bats
* lord enemies

BUGFIXES:
* monkeys should still take damage on water/tar
* monkey should tank explosions/fireballs for the player
* clonking should hit both player and monkey
* the `knocked` flag should be reset during the player’s turn
* requeueing should be recursive and in normal priority order
* bombs shouldn’t damage unaggroed enemies
* pixie explosions shouldn’t change terrain or destroy phasing enemies (but still destroy traps/walls)
* non-player damage on Goolem shouldn’t spawn ooze

REFACTORS:
* Refactor harpy AI
* Dragon exhaustion is implemented in a stupid way
* (type % 100) + offset[type / 100] ?

Metal doors try to close themselves before and after each player turn, except
on the first two turns they are open. This explains both the weird priority
thing and the fact that metal doors never close on the turn after opening, even
if there’s nothing in the way.
